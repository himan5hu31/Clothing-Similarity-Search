# Clothing-Similarity-Search
ML model for  ranked list of links to similar items 
## Overview
Clothing Similarity Search is a machine learning project that focuses on providing users with a convenient way to find similar clothing items based on text descriptions. The project utilizes a machine learning model deployed on Google Cloud to analyze the input text and generate a ranked list of links to similar clothing items available on various websites.

## How It Works
1. Input: The user provides a text description of a clothing item.
2. Model Processing: The machine learning model processes the input text and extracts relevant features that capture the clothing item's characteristics.
3. Similarity Calculation: The model computes the similarity between the input text and the text descriptions of clothing items in its database.
4. Ranking: Based on the calculated similarity scores, the model ranks the clothing items from most similar to least similar.
5. Results: The model returns a JSON response containing a ranked list of links to similar clothing items on different websites.
